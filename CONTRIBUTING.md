## Backend changes policy

Any backend code change must be covered by tests.

When changing backend logic:
- add new tests for new behavior;
- update existing tests for changed behavior;
- do not remove failing tests unless the tested behavior was intentionally removed;
- if a backend change does not need tests, explain why in the pull request.
